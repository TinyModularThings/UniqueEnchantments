The Big 5.0.0 Update we have been working on for over a year.    

Sorry that this took so long.   
We simply had a lot of Feature Creep, burnout and a lot of other projects took away time we needed to finish this.   

And this is only part 1 out of 2 major updates.    
But waiting for the final part to complete would take another year so we decided to split the updates into 2.    

Sadly we don't have a real changelog with this since this update has been in the making and we slacked of with the "changelogs".    

But a rough summary on things that were added.    
Small note though before: We are not even looking at different mc versions before the part 2 comes out. So asking for MC version x.xx.xxx isn't even nessesary because we want to complete the overhaul first!

Changelog:   
Version 5.0.0:    
- Added: A lot of new enchantments.    
- Added: New Potions
- Added: A crap ton of banners
- Reworked: A lot of existing enchantments were reworked.    
- Fixed: A ton of bugs    
- Fixed: Incompats with Appoteosis. (Until he breaks our mod again)
